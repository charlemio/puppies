# What should this project be?

So I have a very good idea. I am going to make a tinder clone but for puppies instead and the point will be to rate puppies based on if you'd buy it or not. So the question is posed for the user "Would you buy this puppy?" and then you swipe left or right. I expect most puppies will be bought. I can then compile lists of the puppies with the most purchase power and also, sadly, the ones with the least i.e. the uggliest ones or the least cute ones I suppose.

## Tabs

One tab for swiping the puppies, one for selling puppies and one for watching statistics.

## Top lists

The one with the cutest puppies should be called ... and the one with the uggliest puppies should be called ...
